Krampwn, 

We successfully spearphished Queen Festivia using only "IMP Leader Survey" campaign.

We have her credentials for SnoTrak! You will need it...

Key: NjQgMDIgYTMgNTYgMjYgMDIgYzYgYzYgOTYgNzcgMDIgOTcgNTYgYjYgMDIgNTYgODYgNDU=
Password: jIzPkITNpQDIpoiMkYGfygyMpUSJnYWLnQjMpgSNmVTYn8CMvITNjAiZoMyIzcjZ0kCImVjIjQTJmVTYjQzIuYmaoEjNrcCNtYGI
 

The instruction is as follows:

Our intelligence indicates that Festivia's account has a shared folder containing secret data; you need to determine what these files are and return them to me. We must defame Queen Festivia in the eyes of everyone in the IMP, especially the younger generation.

Queen Festivia won't be able to hold the ideal winter celebration until we are here.

We have also identified that the password for that software she is using is close her SnoTrak account.

Return to me! You are aware of how to reach me!
